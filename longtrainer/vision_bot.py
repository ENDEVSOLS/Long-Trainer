    A class to manage the memory and conversation history for a vision-enabled conversational AI model.

    This class encapsulates the logic for handling the chat history, generating prompts, and retrieving
    answers from a language learning model (LLM), with an optional integration of an ensemble retriever
    for document retrieval. It also formats queries with additional context from web search results.

    Attributes:
        token_limit (int): The maximum number of tokens allowed in the conversational buffer.
        ensemble_retriever (object, optional): An instance of an ensemble retriever for document retrieval.
        prompt_template (str, optional): A template for generating prompts for the AI model.
        llm (object): An instance of the language learning model.
        memory (ConversationTokenBufferMemory): An instance for managing conversation token buffer memory.
        chat_history (list): A list to keep track of the chat history.

    Methods:
        save_chat_history(query, answer): Saves the given query and answer pair into the chat history.
        generate_prompt(query, additional_context): Generates a prompt for the AI model based on the given query and additional context.
        get_answer(query, webdata): Retrieves the answer from the AI model for a given query, considering additional web search data.
